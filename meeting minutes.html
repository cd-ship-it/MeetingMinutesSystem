<p><strong>Key Discussion Points &amp; Decisions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Addressing Misinformation:</strong> There is a
recognition that <strong>a lot of misinformation is flying
around</strong>, which causes great harm. Church leaders are urged to
help <strong>stop or check unclear or speculative information</strong>,
state the facts, and not let estimates or impressions become facts. It
is not enough for only the pastoral team and staff to handle this;
campus church leaders should also help address this problem in their own
churches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frequency of Campus Council Meetings:</strong> Pastor
Chiu encourages each campus to have their own council meeting <strong>at
least every one or two months</strong>. There was some confusion about
the term "Council," clarifying that this evening's meeting is the
"Church Council" for all campuses, while each campus should have its own
council.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restoration of In-person Class 101 Course:</strong> The
<strong>Class 101 course will be restored to an in-person
format</strong>. Previously, this course was not just about
understanding the church and filling out forms, but also an opportunity
to share the church's vision and invite attendees to consider
membership. Pastors are responsible for motivating and encouraging
attendance and membership. The location of the course needs to be
arranged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status of CBI (Crosspoint Bible Institute)
Course:</strong> The CBI course is <strong>currently on hold</strong>
due to many colleagues leaving. Each campus team is encouraged to
initiate different Bible study groups tailored to their congregation's
needs. The goal is to promote the pursuit of scripture and truth within
the church's Life Groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Life Group Review and Training:</strong> The church
currently has dozens of small groups across campuses. It has been
observed that many small groups may not fully align with the original
design and concept of life groups. There is a need for <strong>small
group leader training</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The training is for current leaders and those who could
potentially help start new groups.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal is to <strong>reiterate the philosophy and concept of
life groups</strong> and to <strong>recruit more leaders</strong> to
facilitate development and growth.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>half-day training session</strong> is
proposed.</p></li>
<li><p>The tentative date proposed by the pastoral team is
<strong>Saturday, August 23rd</strong>. This date was chosen to avoid
vacation periods in July and early August and allow families time to
return before the start of the school year.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback is requested on the proposed date and what topics should
be included in the training (e.g., how to organize groups, providing
handles to build leader confidence, reducing leader burden).</p></li>
<li><p>Initially, the training will <strong>focus on Cantonese-speaking
groups</strong>, with separate arrangements for English and Mandarin
groups later to avoid translation issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The training will cover the philosophy, how to help leaders
organize, and how to reduce the burden on leaders.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quarterly Financial Report (Q1 2024):</strong> A
financial report for the first quarter (January-March) of 2024 was
presented.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Total donation income</strong> : This is a significant
drop, and donation income is a major source of revenue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating expenses</strong> remained stable, decreasing
by only about 5% overall. Some categories saw increases (e.g., JKC
expenses slightly up, explained by a payroll period overlapping into
January 2024), while others decreased (e.g., P expenses are
gone).</p></li>
<li><p>Expenses are generally well-controlled, but the main focus is the
decrease in donation and offering income.</p></li>
<li><p>Future financial reports will be presented quarterly to keep
everyone informed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Worship Team Retreat:</strong> A retreat for the worship
team is proposed due to <strong>staffing shortages (tightness)</strong>
and the need for rest and training.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many campuses feel the strain of insufficient personnel in the
worship teams. Teams that used to have 4-6 people now sometimes only
have two (one instrumentalist, one singer).</p></li>
<li><p>The retreat aims to provide rest and <strong>training/refreshment
on the concept of worship</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Topics would include the meaning and attitude of worship, how to
lead the congregation into worship, and how worship team members can
worship themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The church had similar worship retreats many years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>The retreat also serves as an opportunity to <strong>recruit new
interested members</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential speakers or trainers with expertise in worship ministry
are mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>one-day retreat</strong> is proposed.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed date is <strong>Saturday, July
12th</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion arose regarding the process for recruiting new worship
team members; historically, it involved pastoral recommendation and
jamming/auditioning, focusing on fit rather than just skill. The current
process needs clarification.</p></li>
<li><p>This retreat is for the worship team. Language arrangements
(Cantonese, English, Mandarin) are a consideration, similar to the small
group training. The proposed July 12th date is for the Cantonese
group.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>25th Anniversary Celebration Committee:</strong> A
committee will be formed to plan the <strong>church's 25th anniversary
celebration</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The church was founded 25 years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Fred has agreed to take the lead in this effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Planning a celebration requires broad participation, not just one
or two people.</p></li>
<li><p>For the 20th anniversary, a project manager was appointed. Wing
Suen, is suggested as a suitable person to assist Fred, although she has
not yet been contacted.</p></li>
<li><p>The suggestion is for each of the <strong>five campuses to
nominate one representative</strong> to join the committee, resulting in
a total of seven members (Fred, Wing Suen, and 5 campus reps). This is
considered a manageable size for discussion and planning.</p></li>
<li><p>These campus representatives will not only participate in
planning but also <strong>lead a local committee within their
campus</strong> to promote and coordinate participation throughout the
church.</p></li>
<li><p>The decision was <strong>approved</strong> by consensus; silence
is taken as agreement. Campuses are tasked with identifying and sending
the name of their representative to Fred by the <strong>first week of
June, preferably by June 7th</strong>, or earlier if possible, given the
timeline for planning events later in the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestions for celebration activities (e.g., a "40 days of Bible
reading" program) were welcomed but will be discussed and decided by the
committee once it is formed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjustment to Church Council Composition:</strong> The
current composition of the Church Council includes all pastors and
church staff, which results in a large number of attendees (e.g., around
30 tonight), making discussion difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A proposal is made to <strong>adjust the council
composition</strong> to make it more effective for discussion and
decision-making during this transitional period.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed new structure for the Church Council is: <strong>All
Full-time Pastoral Staff</strong> plus <strong>one or two
representatives from each campus</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of representatives from each campus would be based on
the average attendance: <strong>Two representatives for campuses with
over 100 regular attendees</strong>, and <strong>one representative for
campuses with 100 or fewer attendees</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>These campus representatives would be lay leaders chosen by their
respective campuses.</p></li>
<li><p>The Campus Pastor are expected to oversee all ministries within
their campus and bring relevant information and perspectives to the
Council. The lay representatives would provide input from the
congregational perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>This adjusted composition is intended to be a
<strong>transitional arrangement</strong> until the Church Constitution
is reviewed and updated.</p></li>
<li><p>The Church Constitution has not been updated in over 20 years and
does not reflect the current structure of multiple campuses. A committee
will be formed to review and revise the constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed adjustment to the Council composition was
<strong>approved</strong> by consensus; silence is taken as agreement.
The campuses need to identify their representatives.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Frequency and Format of Church Council Meetings:</strong>
In the past, the Church Council (or similar body) might have only met
once a year to discuss the budget and overall direction. Pastor Chiu
hopes for <strong>more frequent meetings</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the adjusted composition (fewer people), Pastor Chiu
strongly prefers <strong>in-person meetings</strong> for better
discussion and understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>The next Church Council meeting is tentatively scheduled for
<strong>mid-August, after the 13th</strong>, possibly around the second
week.</p></li>
<li><p>The specific date, time (evening on a weekday or weekend), and
location (rotating among campuses) will be decided based on availability
and preference of the chosen representatives.</p></li>
<li><p>More meetings will be held this year (likely two more after this
one) to plan for next year, including the budget, which is typically
finalized around November/December.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> Pastor Chiu emphasizes that
<strong>it is a critical transitional time</strong> for the church and
encourages everyone to <strong>reflect on their commitment to Jesus'
life</strong>, to <strong>pray for the church</strong>, and not to give
up, trusting that God has not given up on the church. Gratitude is
expressed for the feedback received, and attendees are encouraged to
continue providing input to the pastoral team and leaders.</p>
