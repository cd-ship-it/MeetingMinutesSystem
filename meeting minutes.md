**Key Discussion Points & Decisions:**

1.  **Addressing Misinformation:** There is a recognition that **a lot
    of misinformation is flying around**, which causes great harm.
    Church leaders are urged to help **stop or check unclear or
    speculative information**, state the facts, and not let estimates or
    impressions become facts. It is not enough for only the pastoral
    team and staff to handle this; campus church leaders should also
    help address this problem in their own churches.

2.  **Frequency of Campus Council Meetings:** Pastor Chiu encourages
    each campus to have their own council meeting **at least every one
    or two months**. There was some confusion about the term
    \"Council,\" clarifying that this evening\'s meeting is the \"Church
    Council\" for all campuses, while each campus should have its own
    council.

3.  **Restoration of In-person Class 101 Course:** The **Class 101
    course will be restored to an in-person format**. Previously, this
    course was not just about understanding the church and filling out
    forms, but also an opportunity to share the church\'s vision and
    invite attendees to consider membership. Pastors are responsible for
    motivating and encouraging attendance and membership. The location
    of the course needs to be arranged.

4.  **Status of CBI (Crosspoint Bible Institute) Course:** The CBI
    course is **currently on hold** due to many colleagues leaving. Each
    campus team is encouraged to initiate different Bible study groups
    tailored to their congregation\'s needs. The goal is to promote the
    pursuit of scripture and truth within the church\'s Life Groups.

5.  **Life Group Review and Training:** The church currently has dozens
    of small groups across campuses. It has been observed that many
    small groups may not fully align with the original design and
    concept of life groups. There is a need for **small group leader
    training**.

    - The training is for current leaders and those who could
      potentially help start new groups.

    - The goal is to **reiterate the philosophy and concept of life
      groups** and to **recruit more leaders** to facilitate development
      and growth.

    - A **half-day training session** is proposed.

    - The tentative date proposed by the pastoral team is **Saturday,
      August 23rd**. This date was chosen to avoid vacation periods in
      July and early August and allow families time to return before the
      start of the school year.

    - Feedback is requested on the proposed date and what topics should
      be included in the training (e.g., how to organize groups,
      providing handles to build leader confidence, reducing leader
      burden).

    - Initially, the training will **focus on Cantonese-speaking
      groups**, with separate arrangements for English and Mandarin
      groups later to avoid translation issues.

    - The training will cover the philosophy, how to help leaders
      organize, and how to reduce the burden on leaders.

6.  **Quarterly Financial Report (Q1 2024):** A financial report for the
    first quarter (January-March) of 2024 was presented.

    - **Total donation income** : This is a significant drop, and
      donation income is a major source of revenue.

    - **Operating expenses** remained stable, decreasing by only about
      5% overall. Some categories saw increases (e.g., JKC expenses
      slightly up, explained by a payroll period overlapping into
      January 2024), while others decreased (e.g., P expenses are gone).

    - Expenses are generally well-controlled, but the main focus is the
      decrease in donation and offering income.

    - Future financial reports will be presented quarterly to keep
      everyone informed.

7.  **Worship Team Retreat:** A retreat for the worship team is proposed
    due to **staffing shortages (tightness)** and the need for rest and
    training.

    - Many campuses feel the strain of insufficient personnel in the
      worship teams. Teams that used to have 4-6 people now sometimes
      only have two (one instrumentalist, one singer).

    - The retreat aims to provide rest and **training/refreshment on the
      concept of worship**.

    - Topics would include the meaning and attitude of worship, how to
      lead the congregation into worship, and how worship team members
      can worship themselves.

    - The church had similar worship retreats many years ago.

    - The retreat also serves as an opportunity to **recruit new
      interested members**.

    - Potential speakers or trainers with expertise in worship ministry
      are mentioned.

    - A **one-day retreat** is proposed.

    - The proposed date is **Saturday, July 12th**.

    - Discussion arose regarding the process for recruiting new worship
      team members; historically, it involved pastoral recommendation
      and jamming/auditioning, focusing on fit rather than just skill.
      The current process needs clarification.

    - This retreat is for the worship team. Language arrangements
      (Cantonese, English, Mandarin) are a consideration, similar to the
      small group training. The proposed July 12th date is for the
      Cantonese group.

8.  **25th Anniversary Celebration Committee:** A committee will be
    formed to plan the **church\'s 25th anniversary celebration**.

    - The church was founded 25 years ago.

    - Fred has agreed to take the lead in this effort.

    - Planning a celebration requires broad participation, not just one
      or two people.

    - For the 20th anniversary, a project manager was appointed. Wing
      Suen, is suggested as a suitable person to assist Fred, although
      she has not yet been contacted.

    - The suggestion is for each of the **five campuses to nominate one
      representative** to join the committee, resulting in a total of
      seven members (Fred, Wing Suen, and 5 campus reps). This is
      considered a manageable size for discussion and planning.

    - These campus representatives will not only participate in planning
      but also **lead a local committee within their campus** to promote
      and coordinate participation throughout the church.

    - The decision was **approved** by consensus; silence is taken as
      agreement. Campuses are tasked with identifying and sending the
      name of their representative to Fred by the **first week of June,
      preferably by June 7th**, or earlier if possible, given the
      timeline for planning events later in the year.

    - Suggestions for celebration activities (e.g., a \"40 days of Bible
      reading\" program) were welcomed but will be discussed and decided
      by the committee once it is formed.

9.  **Adjustment to Church Council Composition:** The current
    composition of the Church Council includes all pastors and church
    staff, which results in a large number of attendees (e.g., around 30
    tonight), making discussion difficult.

    - A proposal is made to **adjust the council composition** to make
      it more effective for discussion and decision-making during this
      transitional period.

    - The proposed new structure for the Church Council is: **All
      Full-time Pastoral Staff** plus **one or two representatives from
      each campus**.

    - The number of representatives from each campus would be based on
      the average attendance: **Two representatives for campuses with
      over 100 regular attendees**, and **one representative for
      campuses with 100 or fewer attendees**.

    - These campus representatives would be lay leaders chosen by their
      respective campuses.

    - The Campus Pastor are expected to oversee all ministries within
      their campus and bring relevant information and perspectives to
      the Council. The lay representatives would provide input from the
      congregational perspective.

    - This adjusted composition is intended to be a **transitional
      arrangement** until the Church Constitution is reviewed and
      updated.

    - The Church Constitution has not been updated in over 20 years and
      does not reflect the current structure of multiple campuses. A
      committee will be formed to review and revise the constitution.

    - The proposed adjustment to the Council composition was
      **approved** by consensus; silence is taken as agreement. The
      campuses need to identify their representatives.

10. **Frequency and Format of Church Council Meetings:** In the past,
    the Church Council (or similar body) might have only met once a year
    to discuss the budget and overall direction. Pastor Chiu hopes for
    **more frequent meetings**.

    - With the adjusted composition (fewer people), Pastor Chiu strongly
      prefers **in-person meetings** for better discussion and
      understanding.

    - The next Church Council meeting is tentatively scheduled for
      **mid-August, after the 13th**, possibly around the second week.

    - The specific date, time (evening on a weekday or weekend), and
      location (rotating among campuses) will be decided based on
      availability and preference of the chosen representatives.

    - More meetings will be held this year (likely two more after this
      one) to plan for next year, including the budget, which is
      typically finalized around November/December.

**Action Items:**

- Each campus to hold their own council meetings **at least every one or
  two months**.

- Pastoral team to arrange the location for the **restored in-person
  Membership 101 course**.

- Each campus team to initiate different **Bible study groups** based on
  their congregation\'s needs.

- Pastoral team/Campus Pastors to arrange and implement the **small
  group leader training/retreat**. The date is tentatively August 23rd.

- Pastoral team/Campus Pastors to arrange and implement the **worship
  team retreat**. The date for the Cantonese session is tentatively July
  12th. Arrangements for Mandarin and English sessions will follow.

- Campuses to **identify and nominate one representative** for the 25th
  Anniversary Celebration Committee. Nominees should have organizational
  ability and be able to mobilize help within their campus. The list of
  nominees is due by the **first week of June (preferably by June
  7th)**. Send names to Fred.

- Campuses to **identify and nominate one or two representatives** for
  the adjusted Church Council composition (based on attendance numbers).
  Nominees should be lay leaders. The list of nominees is due by the
  **first week of June (preferably by June 7th)**.

- Pastor Chiu and others (implied pastoral/leadership team) to **plan
  the details for the Worship Team Retreat**.

- Pastor Chiu and other relevant individuals to **follow up on how to
  handle the language aspect (Mandarin/English)** for the worship
  retreat.

- Pastor Chiu and others (implied pastoral/leadership team) to **plan
  the details for the Small Group Leader Training**.

- Pastor Chiu to **collect feedback** on potential dates/times/locations
  for the next in-person Church Council meeting in mid-August.

- The **Church Constitution Review Committee** will be formally
  established at the upcoming membership meeting.

- The **Ordination Committee** will be formally established at the
  upcoming membership meeting.

**Closing Remarks:** Pastor Chiu emphasizes that **it is a critical
transitional time** for the church and encourages everyone to **reflect
on their commitment to Jesus\' life**, to **pray for the church**, and
not to give up, trusting that God has not given up on the church.
Gratitude is expressed for the feedback received, and attendees are
encouraged to continue providing input to the pastoral team and leaders.
